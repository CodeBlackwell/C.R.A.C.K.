BloodTrail CLI Package

Modular command-line interface for BloodTrail.
Commands are organized into logical groups for maintainability.

This package provides:
- BaseCommandGroup: Abstract base class for command handlers
- Parser: Argument parser with all command flags
- Command groups for each functional area
- Interactive helpers for credential entry
