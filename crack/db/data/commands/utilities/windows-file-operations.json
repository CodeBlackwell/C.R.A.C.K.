Navigate to target directory: cd C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\n3. Verify file exists: dir\n4. Read file: type flag.txt\n5. Copy flag for documentation (screenshot or copy-paste)\n6. Verify flag format (32 chars MD5, 40 chars SHA1, or custom)\n7. Submit flag\n\nCOMMON OSCP FILE READING TARGETS:\n\n**1. FLAGS:**\n- Admin flag: type C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\flag.txt\n- User flag: type C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\Desktop\\local.txt\n- Proof flag: type C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\proof.txt\n- Root flag: type C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\root.txt\n- Custom locations: type C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\flag.txt, type C:\\temp\\flag.txt\n\n**2.

COMBINE MULTIPLE FILES:**\n```powershell\nGet-Content C:\\Users\\*\\Desktop\\*.txt                 # All desktop txt files\nGet-Content C:\\logs\\*.log | Select-String 'error'    # All logs with errors\nGet-ChildItem C:\\configs\\*.config | Get-Content | Select-String 'password'  # Recursive\n```\n\n**6. ADVANCED FILTERING:**\n```powershell\n# Extract lines between patterns\nGet-Content file.txt | Select-String -Pattern 'START' -Context 0,100 | Select-String -Pattern 'END' -Context 100,0\n\n# Count occurrences\nGet-Content log.txt | Select-String 'error' | Measure-Object\n\n# Get unique lines\nGet-Content file.txt | Sort-Object -Unique\n\n# Extract specific columns (CSV-like)\nGet-Content file.txt | ForEach-Object { ($_ -split '\\s+')[2] }  # 3rd column\n```\n\n**7. OUTPUT MANIPULATION:**\n```powershell\n# Save to variable\n$content = Get-Content C:\\file.txt\n\n# Export to file\nGet-Content input.txt | Out-File C:\\temp\\output.txt -Encoding UTF8\n\n# Convert to single string\n$text = Get-Content file.txt -Raw\n\n# Base64 encode\n$bytes = Get-Content file.exe -Encoding Byte\n[Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes) | Out-File file.b64\n```\n\n**OSCP EXAM SCENARIOS:**\n\n**Flag Retrieval:**\n```powershell\nGet-Content C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\flag.txt\ncat C:\\Users\\*\\Desktop\\*.txt  # All user desktop files (find both user and admin flags)\n```\n\n**Credential Hunting:**\n```powershell\n# PowerShell history (commands with passwords)\nGet-Content $env:USERPROFILE\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadLine\\ConsoleHost_history.txt | Select-String 'password'\n\n# Unattend.xml (local admin password)\nGet-Content C:\\Windows\\Panther\\Unattend.xml -Encoding Unicode | Select-String 'Password'\n\n# Web.config (database credentials)\nGet-Content C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\web.config | Select-String 'connectionString|password'\n\n# Configuration files (various apps)\nGet-ChildItem C:\\ -Recurse -Include *.config,*.ini,*.xml -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Get-Content | Select-String 'password'\n```\n\n**Enumeration Output Analysis:**\n```powershell\n# winPEAS output\nGet-Content C:\\temp\\winPEAS.txt | Select-String 'password|credential|Modifiable'\n\n# Mimikatz output\nGet-Content C:\\temp\\mimikatz.txt | Select-String 'NTLM|Password'\n\n# BloodHound data verification\nGet-Content C:\\temp\\*.json | Select-Object -First 10  # Verify JSON structure\n```\n\n**Log Analysis:**\n```powershell\n# IIS logs for admin activity\nGet-Content C:\\inetpub\\logs\\LogFiles\\W3SVC1\\*.log -Tail 100 | Select-String 'admin|POST'\n\n# Application logs\nGet-Content C:\\Program Files\\App\\logs\\*.log | Select-String 'error|exception' -Context 2,2\n\n# Event logs (requires Export-Csv from Get-EventLog first)\nGet-Content C:\\temp\\security.csv | Select-String '4624|4625'  # Logon events\n```\n\n**VS. CMD TYPE:**\n| Feature | Get-Content (PowerShell) | type (CMD) |\n|---------|-------------------------|------------|\n| Speed | Slower (object pipeline) | Faster |\n| Encoding | Supports all encodings | ASCII/UTF-8 only |\n| Filtering | Native (\\| Select-String) | Pipe to findstr |\n| Tail | -Tail flag built-in | Requires workarounds |\n| Wildcards | Supports *.txt | Not supported |\n| Pipeline | Object-oriented | Text stream |\n| Availability | PowerShell sessions only | All CMD sessions |\n| OSCP Use | Evil-WinRM, PS shells | CMD shells, universal |\n\n**ALIASES:**\n- cat → Get-Content (Linux-style)\n- gc → Get-Content (short form)\n- type → Get-Content (in PowerShell - NOT CMD)\n\n**EXAM TIP:** Use Get-Content in Evil-WinRM and PowerShell reverse shells. Use CMD 'type' in basic reverse shells without PowerShell.\n\n**COMMON MISTAKES:**\n❌ Using Get-Content in CMD shell: 'Get-Content' is not recognized\n❌ Wrong encoding: Get-Content web.config shows garbage → Use -Encoding UTF8\n❌ Not filtering large files: Reading 10GB log with no filter → Use -Tail or Select-String\n❌ Forgetting quotes for paths with spaces: Get-Content C:\\Program Files\\file.txt → 'C:\\Program Files\\file.txt'\n❌ Mixing CMD and PowerShell syntax: Get-Content file.txt | findstr 'pattern' (works but inconsistent - use Select-String)",
