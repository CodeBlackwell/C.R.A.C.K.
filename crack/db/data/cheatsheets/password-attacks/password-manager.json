Decision: Use top 10k wordlist (10k ÷ 10 = 1,000 seconds = 16 minutes - viable). If fails, try top 100k (2.7 hours). Key insight: KeePass designed to resist cracking - must use targeted wordlists.",

Success depends on: User chose WEAK master password (defeats purpose of password manager!), Password in top N of wordlist, Patience (slow cracking requires time).

This defeats purpose - attacker with filesystem access has BOTH files. Keyfile format: Usually .key file (binary data) or any file (image, text, executable). Hash must include keyfile data for cracking tools to replicate key derivation. Success because: User chose weak password, Keyfile available to attacker, Tools support keyfile-based hashes.
