  "notes": "Capabilities are less common than SUID but critical to check during enumeration. Network capabilities (cap_net_raw, cap_net_admin) are non-exploitable for privilege escalation. cap_setuid provides instant root shell similar to SUID but cleaner. cap_dac_override allows read/write to any file (edit /etc/passwd for UID 0). cap_dac_read_search allows reading sensitive files (shadow, SSH keys). Always check GTFOBins capabilities section for exploitation techniques. Multiple capabilities on single binary may provide multiple exploitation paths. Capabilities persist after file execution unlike SUID.",
