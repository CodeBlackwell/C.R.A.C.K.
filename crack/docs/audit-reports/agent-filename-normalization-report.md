# Agent Filename Normalization Report

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Agent:** Agent 4 - Filename Normalizer
**Task:** Rename 4 non-descriptive agent files to kebab-case descriptive names

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully renamed 4 "clever" agent filenames to descriptive kebab-case format following project naming conventions. All agents now have instantly understandable purposes from their filenames alone.

**Status:** Complete
**Files Renamed:** 4
**References Updated:** 1 (README.md)
**Attribution References:** 200+ (left unchanged intentionally)

---

## Renamed Files

### 1. CR4CK-DEV.md → 06-track-feature-developer.md

**Purpose Identified:** Implements new features for CRACK Track enumeration system

**Rationale:**
- Original: Leetspeak "CRACK" + "DEV" (unclear purpose)
- New: Clearly indicates Track feature development role
- Number: 06 (continues numbered agent sequence)

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Creating modules that integrate with existing architecture
- Following naming conventions and code style
- Writing comprehensive tests that prove value
- Zero-dependency implementations using Python stdlib

**Use Cases:**
- Adding new functionality to CRACK Track
- Implementing wordlist selection systems
- Creating interactive TUI features
- Integrating new enumeration capabilities

---

### 2. CR4KSMITH.md → 07-security-tool-builder.md

**Purpose Identified:** Creates minimalist, high-impact pentesting tools

**Rationale:**
- Original: Leetspeak "CRACK" + "SMITH" (blacksmith metaphor unclear)
- New: Explicitly describes security tool building capability
- Number: 07 (sequential numbering)

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Builds OSCP-focused tools (150-300 lines max)
- Enforces minimalist design principles
- Provides structured, colored output
- Includes actionable next steps (decision trees)
- Works on default Kali Linux without dependencies

**Critical Requirement:** ALL tools must provide "Next Steps" recommendations in decision tree format

**Use Cases:**
- Creating new enumeration tools
- Building exploitation helpers
- Generating report formatters
- Crafting payload generators

---

### 3. CrackPot.md → 08-hacktricks-service-miner.md

**Purpose Identified:** Mines HackTricks pentesting guides to generate CRACK Track service plugins

**Rationale:**
- Original: "CrackPot" (playful but unclear - cooking reference?)
- New: Describes exact function - mining HackTricks for service plugins
- Number: 08 (sequential numbering)

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Parses markdown documentation from HackTricks
- Extracts enumeration commands with full context
- Generates ServicePlugin classes with decision trees
- Adds OSCP educational enhancements (manual alternatives, indicators)
- Creates comprehensive task trees with metadata

**Output:** Production-ready Python ServicePlugin classes with full OSCP context

**Use Cases:**
- Generating new service plugins from documentation
- Expanding CRACK Track service coverage
- Mining Nmap cookbook for scan profiles
- Converting manual techniques to automated workflows

**Note on Attribution:** 200+ service plugin files contain "Generated by: CrackPot v1.0" attribution comments. These were left unchanged as they reference the agent's work output, not the agent file itself.

---

### 4. TRACKER.md → 09-track-enhancement-specialist.md

**Purpose Identified:** Reduces friction in CRACK Track interactive mode with minimalist CLI improvements

**Rationale:**
- Original: "TRACKER" (too generic - could mean anything tracking-related)
- New: Specific role - enhancing Track's interactive experience
- Number: 09 (completes numbered agent sequence 00-09)

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Single-purpose, composable tools
- Sub-500ms execution time
- Single-letter shortcuts
- Python stdlib only
- Clear error messages

**Priority Matrix:** Tools that save >10 keystrokes, execute in <500ms, require <100 lines, have 0 dependencies

**Use Cases:**
- Adding quick shortcuts to TUI
- Improving workflow efficiency
- Reducing keystroke requirements
- Creating parseable output tools

## Naming Pattern Analysis

### Before (Problems)

| Old Name | Issues |
|----------|--------|
| `CR4CK-DEV.md` | Leetspeak, unclear purpose, not instantly understandable |
| `CR4KSMITH.md` | Leetspeak, metaphorical (blacksmith), unclear without reading |
| `CrackPot.md` | Playful/joke name, mixed case, unclear function |
| `TRACKER.md` | Generic term, all caps, doesn't describe specific role |

### After (Solutions)

| New Name | Benefits |
|----------|----------|
| `06-track-feature-developer.md` | Clear purpose, numbered sequence, kebab-case |
| `07-security-tool-builder.md` | Explicit function, professional, descriptive |
| `08-hacktricks-service-miner.md` | Precise role description, source & output clear |
| `09-track-enhancement-specialist.md` | Specific focus area, professional terminology |

### Naming Convention Applied

**Format:** `NN-descriptive-purpose.md`

**Rules:**
- Numbers: 06-09 (continues existing 00-05 pattern)
- Case: kebab-case (consistent with existing agents)
- Clarity: Purpose obvious from filename
- No leetspeak, acronyms, or clever naming
- Professional terminology

## References Found and Actions Taken

### Category 1: Agent File References (UPDATED)

**File:** `/home/kali/OSCP/crack/.claude/agents/README.md`
**Action:** Completely rewritten to document all agents with new names
**Impact:** Users now have comprehensive agent directory with usage examples

**Changes:**
- Added detailed descriptions for agents 06-09
- Created "Quick Reference" section for common tasks
- Documented "When to Use" for each specialized agent
- Added usage examples for tool creation, plugin generation, etc.
- Established naming convention rules

### Category 2: Attribution Comments (NO CHANGE)

**Pattern:** "Generated by: CrackPot v1.0"
**Count:** 200+ files in `/home/kali/OSCP/crack/track/services/`
**Action:** Left unchanged
**Rationale:** These reference the agent's work output, not the agent file itself. Historical attribution should remain for:
- Credit to development approach
- Version tracking of plugin generation
- Documentation of automation method

**Example Files:**
- `track/services/ftp.py`
- `track/services/ssh.py`
- `track/services/smtp.py`
- `track/services/lateral_movement.py`
- (196+ more service plugins)

### Category 3: Documentation References (NO CHANGE)

**Pattern:** References to CrackPot agent in documentation
**Files:**
- `track/README.md` - "CrackPot agent can mine Nmap cookbook"
- `track/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - "CrackPot can mine Nmap cookbook"
- `track/docs/SCAN_PROFILES.md` - "CrackPot agent (Automated)"
- Various implementation docs and changelogs

**Action:** Left unchanged
**Rationale:**
1. Documentation describes historical development process
2. "CrackPot" is the agent's working name/brand in docs
3. Changing would create confusion in historical context
4. Agents README now provides proper reference to file location

**Future Recommendation:** In new documentation, reference agent by filename: `08-hacktricks-service-miner.md` or by formal name from agent metadata.

### Category 4: Implementation Comments (NO CHANGE)

**Pattern:** "CR4CK-DEV: Complete @ 2025-10-09"
**File:** `track/docs/archive/development/WORDLIST_SELECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
**Action:** Left unchanged
**Rationale:** Historical implementation tracking - dated completion markers should not be modified retroactively

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts

1. **Instant Clarity**: Developers can identify agent purpose from filename alone
2. **Professional Appearance**: No leetspeak or joke names in production codebase
3. **Consistency**: All agents follow same naming pattern (numbered + kebab-case)
4. **Discoverability**: New users can browse agent directory and understand options
5. **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive README provides usage guidance

### No Negative Impacts

- Historical attribution preserved (200+ "CrackPot" references unchanged)
- Documentation context maintained (agent mentioned by working name in docs)
- Zero functionality changes (agent content unchanged)
- No broken references (only README updated to reflect new names)

---

## Recommendations

### For Future Agent Development

1. **Always use descriptive names**: Avoid clever/cute naming
2. **Follow numbering**: Next agent should be `10-[descriptive-purpose].md`
3. **Update README immediately**: Add new agent to README upon creation
4. **Include usage examples**: Document "When to Use" for each agent
5. **Maintain consistency**: kebab-case, numbered, professional

### For Existing Documentation

**Optional (Not Required):**
- In future documentation, reference agents by filename: `08-hacktricks-service-miner.md`
- When discussing agent capabilities, link to README agent section
- For historical docs, consider footnote: "CrackPot (now 08-hacktricks-service-miner.md)"

**Do Not Change:**
- Service plugin attribution comments ("Generated by: CrackPot v1.0")
- Historical implementation tracking comments
- Existing documentation narrative flow
