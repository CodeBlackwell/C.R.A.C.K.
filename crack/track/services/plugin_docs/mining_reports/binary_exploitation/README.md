# Binary Exploitation Reports

[← Back to Main Index](../../README.md)

---

## Overview

**4 reports** (OSCP-focused) - x86/x64 exploitation, ROP chains, and reverse shells

**Archived:** 6 reports moved to `/archive/low_priority/` (ARM64, browser exploits, duplicates)

---

## Active Reports (OSCP:HIGH/MEDIUM)

- [ROP Chain Mining Report](./rop_mining_report.md) - OSCP:HIGH for basics, OSCP:LOW for advanced
- [Stack Overflow Mining Report](./stack_overflow_mining_report.md) - OSCP:HIGH (x86/x64 buffer overflows)
- [Reverse Shells Plugin Mining Report](./REVERSE_SHELLS_MINING_REPORT.md) - OSCP:HIGH (shell generation)

**Note:** Lowercase remine versions (Oct 9) supersede uppercase originals (Oct 7) - duplicates deleted in consolidation.

## Archived Reports (Low OSCP Priority)

**Location:** `/track/services/plugin_docs/archive/low_priority/`

- `arm64_mining_report.md` - OSCP:LOW (exam uses x86/x64 only)
- `browser_exploit_mining_report.md` - OSCP:NONE (client-side exploitation not tested)

**Deleted (Superseded):**
- ~~ARM64_MINING_REPORT.md~~ - Replaced by arm64_mining_report.md (now archived)
- ~~BROWSER_EXPLOIT_MINING_REPORT.md~~ - Replaced by browser_exploit_mining_report.md (now archived)
- ~~MINING_REPORT_STACK_OVERFLOW.md~~ - Replaced by stack_overflow_mining_report.md
- ~~ROP_MINING_REPORT.md~~ - Replaced by rop_mining_report.md

## Key Topics Covered

- **Stack Exploitation:** Buffer overflows, ROP techniques
- **Architecture-Specific:** ARM64 binary exploitation
- **Browser Exploits:** Modern browser vulnerability research
- **Reverse Shells:** Shell generation and evasion
- **Advanced Techniques:** Modern exploitation methods

## Usage Notes

### For OSCP Exam
- Focus on HIGH relevance reports
- Practice manual alternatives when tools fail
- Track sources for report documentation

### Statistics
- **Active Reports:** 3 (OSCP-focused)
- **Archived Reports:** 2 (low OSCP priority)
- **Deleted Reports:** 4 (superseded duplicates)
- **Category:** Binary Exploitation Reports

### Consolidation Notes (2025-10-10)
- Phase 1: Deleted 4 uppercase duplicate originals (69 KB)
- Phase 3: Archived 2 low-OSCP-relevance reports (39 KB)
- Result: 3 OSCP-focused reports remain active
