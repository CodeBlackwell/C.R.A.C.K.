          "title": "Scenario 1: WinRM Lateral Movement with Flag Retrieval",
          "context": "You compromised CLIENT74 as user 'jeff' and obtained credentials for domain admin 'jen' (password: Nexus123!). Target server WEB04 (192.168.117.70) has WinRM enabled. You need to move laterally and retrieve the Administrator desktop flag without establishing interactive session.",
          "approach": "Use Invoke-Command to execute remote PowerShell commands via WinRM. First create PSCredential object with jen's credentials, then use Invoke-Command with -ScriptBlock to read flag file directly from Administrator's desktop. This one-liner approach completes lateral movement and flag retrieval in a single command without requiring persistent session.",

          "expected_outcome": "Complete one-liner executes in 5-15 seconds, returns flag content directly to your console. No interactive session needed. Success rate: 95% when WinRM enabled and credentials valid. Typical OSCP scenario - saves 2-3 minutes versus interactive session approach.",
          "why_this_works": "WinRM allows remote PowerShell execution for domain users in Administrators or Remote Management Users group. Invoke-Command with -ScriptBlock executes Get-Content on remote host and returns results to local console. PSCredential object bypasses interactive authentication prompts. UAC remote restrictions do not apply to domain users, providing full admin privileges."

          "approach": "Use WMI/CIM sessions via DCOM protocol as alternative to WinRM. Create CimSession using New-CimSessionOption with -Protocol DCOM, then use Invoke-CimMethod with Win32_Process.Create to spawn reverse shell process. Shell runs in session 0 as SYSTEM, invisible to logged-in users. Pre-generate base64-encoded PowerShell reverse shell using Python encoder script.",

Success rate: 85% when RPC available and high port range (49152-65535) not blocked by firewall. Critical backup technique when WinRM unavailable - demonstrates protocol diversity for OSCP exam.",
          "why_this_works": "WMI uses RPC over port 135 + dynamic high ports for remote process creation. Win32_Process.Create method spawns processes as SYSTEM service in session 0. DCOM protocol bypasses WinRM requirements. Base64 encoding avoids special character escaping issues in command-line arguments. Reverse shells initiate outbound connection, bypassing inbound firewall rules that might block bind shells."

          "context": "You gained access to domain-joined workstation as standard domain user. Need to enumerate AD environment (domain controllers, privileged users, groups) without uploading PowerView or SharpHound which might trigger AV/EDR alerts.",
          "approach": "Use built-in .NET classes accessible via PowerShell: [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory.Domain]::GetCurrentDomain() for domain info and [adsisearcher] type accelerator for LDAP queries. These methods use native Windows APIs, require no tool uploads, and have minimal detection footprint. Query for privileged accounts using adminCount=1 LDAP filter to identify high-value targets.",

Success rate: 99% on domain-joined hosts. Critical for OSCP AD labs when tool uploads blocked or detected. Demonstrates understanding of underlying AD protocols.",
          "why_this_works": "[adsisearcher] is PowerShell type accelerator for System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher which performs LDAP queries against AD. Automatically uses current user's domain credentials and binds to domain context. GetCurrentDomain() leverages System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectory namespace for domain topology information. Both methods are built into Windows/.NET Framework - no external dependencies. LDAP filters like (&(objectClass=user)(adminCount=1)) identify protected admin accounts flagged by AdminSDHolder process."

          "context": "You escalated privileges to Administrator on Windows workstation. Before moving laterally, search for additional credentials in registry AutoLogon keys, configuration files, and PowerShell history that might enable access to other systems.",
          "approach": "Execute three quick one-liners: (1) Check registry HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon for AutoLogon cleartext passwords, (2) Search filesystem for unattend.xml and web.config files containing deployment/database credentials, (3) Read PowerShell command history files where users may have typed credentials in plaintext commands.",

Common finds: AutoLogon credentials (30% of OSCP lab hosts), unattend.xml with local admin passwords (20%), database connection strings in web.config files (40% of web servers). Found credentials often enable lateral movement to additional hosts or provide domain admin access through password reuse.",
          "why_this_works": "Windows AutoLogon feature stores credentials in plaintext registry keys (DefaultUserName/DefaultPassword) for convenience - common misconfiguration in lab environments. Deployment answer files (unattend.xml, sysprep.inf) contain local admin passwords used during Windows installation. Web applications store database credentials in web.config files. PowerShell history (ConsoleHost_history.txt) logs all commands including those with embedded credentials. Credential reuse is pervasive in corporate environments - same passwords used across multiple systems."
