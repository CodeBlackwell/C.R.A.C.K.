  "notes": "OSCP HIGH-PRIORITY: Kerberoasting is one of the most successful AD attacks. SUCCESS RATE: High in corporate environments (60-80% of domains have service accounts with weak passwords). WHY IT WORKS: ANY authenticated domain user can request TGS for ANY SPN - no permission checks at TGS request time. The TGS is encrypted with service account password hash, allowing offline cracking. TARGET ACCOUNTS: Service accounts with SPNs (SQL Server, IIS, custom services). CRITICAL: Computer accounts (MACHINE$) and Managed Service Accounts (MSAs) have 120-character random passwords - UNCRACKABLE. Focus on USER accounts with SPNs (sql_service, iis_service, svc_backup, etc.). ENCRYPTION TYPES: Modern domains use AES (slower to crack). Use Rubeus /tgtdeleg flag to downgrade to RC4 (10x faster cracking). TIME ESTIMATE: SPN enum (10 sec) + TGS request (10 sec) + cracking (1 min - 2 hours depending on password strength and wordlist). NO LOCKOUT RISK: Requesting TGS doesn't trigger account lockout. STEALTH: Event ID 4769 (TGS request) - normal Kerberos traffic, difficult to distinguish from legitimate service access. COMPLEMENTARY TO AS-REP ROASTING: Different attack surface - Kerberoasting targets service accounts, AS-REP targets misconfigured user accounts.",
