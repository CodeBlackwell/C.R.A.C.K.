# Chain Templates Directory

This directory stores reusable attack chain building blocks that can be
composed into full chain definitions. Templates keep common sequences
(such as web shell deployment or credential replay) consistent across the
library while allowing future phases to assemble them programmatically.

No templates are defined yet; placeholder file exists to ensure the
structure is tracked in version control.
