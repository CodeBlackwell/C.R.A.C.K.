WHY THIS WORKS: Uploads binary to ADMIN$ share, creates Windows service, executes payload as SYSTEM. HOW IT WORKS: 1) Connects to IPC$ share, 2) Uploads RemCom.exe to ADMIN$ share, 3) Creates/starts service via SCM, 4) Service executes RemCom.exe as SYSTEM, 5) Spawns cmd.exe shell. ADVANTAGES: Spawns SYSTEM shell (highest privilege), most reliable for OSCP, well-documented. DISADVANTAGES: Writes binary to disk (forensics), creates service (event logs), easier to detect than WMI/DCOM. MANUAL ALTERNATIVE: Microsoft PsExec64.exe from Sysinternals (see psexec-sysinternals). UAC LIMITATION: 2014 Microsoft patch blocks local admin PTH for non-RID-500 accounts (domain users unaffected). CLEANUP: PSExec automatically cleans up service and binary on exit. BEHIND THE SCENES: Service creation generates Event ID 7045, authentication creates 4624, process creation 4688. TIME ESTIMATE: 1-2 minutes for connection establishment.

DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: Without -i, PSExec spawns in Session 0 - GUI apps invisible. USE CASE: Social engineering (spawn message to user), GUI tool demonstration, test interactive applications. BEHIND THE SCENES: -i flag tells PSEXESVC service to create process in specified session ID. QUERY SESSIONS: Use 'query user' or 'query session' to enumerate session IDs on target. COMMON SESSION IDS: Session 0 = services, Session 1 = first logged-on user, Session 2+ = additional users (RDP, fast user switching). STEALTH: Visible process to logged-in user - not stealthy. TIME ESTIMATE: 3-5 minutes including session enumeration. EXAM TIP: Rarely needed for OSCP - use standard psexec for command execution.

      "notes": "EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT: Share enumeration confirms ADMIN$ accessibility - prerequisite for PSExec lateral movement. WHY ADMIN$ MATTERS: PSExec uploads binary to ADMIN$ share, creates service, executes payload. PWNED INDICATOR: [+] Pwn3d! confirms user has local administrator rights on target. DEFAULT SHARES: ADMIN$ (C:\\Windows), C$ (C:\\), IPC$ (inter-process communication), print$ (printer drivers). CUSTOM SHARES: Additional shares may contain sensitive data - enumerate contents. PERMISSIONS: READ,WRITE on ADMIN$ required for PSExec. READ-only means user not admin. ALTERNATIVE TOOLS: smbclient -L //<TARGET> -U <USER> (manual), smbmap -u <USER> -p <PASS> -H <TARGET> (detailed permissions). BEHIND THE SCENES: Authenticates to IPC$ share, queries share list via SRVSVC RPC pipe. TIME ESTIMATE: <30 seconds for share enumeration. EXAM TIP: Always verify ADMIN$ accessible before attempting PSExec - saves time troubleshooting failed exploitation.",
