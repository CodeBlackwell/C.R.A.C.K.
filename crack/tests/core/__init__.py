CRACK Core Module Tests

Tests for core infrastructure components:
- ConfigManager: Configuration persistence and variable management
- Themes: Color theming and application
- Utils: Shared utility functions (ports, curl parser)

Business Value Focus:
- Configuration must persist correctly (user settings are not lost)
- Theme application must be consistent (visual coherence)
- Utility functions must handle edge cases (robust tooling)
