Extracts NTLM hashes, LM hashes, Kerberos keys (AES256, AES128, DES), password history, and supplemental credentials for ALL domain users. REQUIRES: Domain Admin, Enterprise Admin, or explicit replication rights (DS-Replication-Get-Changes + DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All). OUTPUT: Full credential dump including password history and Kerberos keys. TIME: 1-10 minutes for full domain (depends on user count: 50 users ~30sec, 500 users ~5min). ADVANTAGE: Works remotely without DC access, stealthier than NTDS.dit file copy, appears as normal replication traffic. DETECTION: Event ID 4662 on DC (replication request from non-DC machine). USE CASE: Post-exploitation after obtaining Domain Admin - dump entire domain for analysis, offline cracking, and persistence planning. COMPARISON: -just-dc (full dump, slow) vs -just-dc-ntlm (NTLM only, faster) vs -just-dc-user (single user, fastest)."
"8a2d15754e2abf4f","-just-dc-ntlm","DCSync mode with NTLM-only extraction (skips Kerberos keys, password history, supplemental credentials). FASTER than -just-dc (30-50% speed improvement) while still providing the most critical credential type (NTLM hashes). OUTPUT FORMAT: domain\user:RID:LMhash:NThash::: - Ready for Pass-the-Hash attacks, offline cracking with Hashcat, or Golden/Silver ticket creation. TIME ESTIMATE: 30-120 seconds for typical OSCP domain (50-200 users). RECOMMENDED FOR OSCP EXAMS: Balances speed and completeness. NTLM hashes are sufficient for PTH, ticket forgery, and credential cracking - you rarely need Kerberos keys unless doing advanced AES-based attacks. MEMORY EFFICIENT: Smaller output (no verbose Kerberos data), easier to parse and store. WHEN TO USE: Time-constrained scenarios (OSCP exam), when you only need hashes for PTH/cracking, or when -just-dc is too slow on large domains."
"b6aef0c27acf0b17","-just-dc-user <username>","DCSync SINGLE USER - Extracts credentials for ONE specific domain account. FASTEST DCSync method (1-5 seconds). RECOMMENDED USAGE: Target high-value accounts (Administrator, krbtgt for Golden tickets, specific domain admins). STEALTH ADVANTAGE: Single-user replication is less suspicious than full domain dump (generates fewer Event ID 4662 logs, appears more like targeted query). OSCP WORKFLOW: After obtaining Domain Admin, immediately DCSync krbtgt (Golden ticket), then DCSync Administrator (backup access), then selectively DCSync other high-value targets. TROUBLESHOOTING: If username not found, verify spelling (case-insensitive but must be exact). For computer accounts, append $ (e.g., DC1$). EXAMPLE: impacket-secretsdump -just-dc-user krbtgt 'corp.com/administrator:Pass123!@192.168.50.70' - Dumps ONLY krbtgt account (for Golden ticket creation)."

REQUIRES: Local Administrator privileges on target (NOT domain admin needed). TARGET: Member servers, workstations (NOT domain controllers - DCs don't store local accounts in SAM). OUTPUT: Local account hashes (Administrator, Guest, custom local accounts). DOES NOT include domain accounts. USE CASE: Lateral movement after compromising local admin on member server - dump local admin hash, reuse across network (password reuse common). COMPARISON: -sam (local accounts) vs -just-dc (domain accounts via DCSync) vs -ntds (domain accounts via file extraction). TIME: <10 seconds.

REQUIRES: Local admin privileges. TARGET: Any Windows machine (member servers, workstations, even DCs). OUTPUT: Plaintext passwords for services, cached domain hashes (can be cracked offline). HIGH VALUE: Often reveals service account plaintext passwords (stored for services running as domain accounts), or cached domain admin credentials from previous logons. TIME: <10 seconds.

TECHNICAL: Bootkey is derived from registry keys in HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa (JD, Skew1, GBG, Data). Secretsdump automatically extracts bootkey and uses it to decrypt SAM/SECURITY hives. TIME: <5 seconds. USAGE: Always specify -system when using -sam or -security.

WORKFLOW: 1) Create VSS snapshot on DC: vssadmin create shadow /for=C:\, 2) Copy NTDS.dit from snapshot: copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit C:\temp\ntds.dit, 3) Copy SYSTEM hive: reg save HKLM\SYSTEM C:\temp\system.hive, 4) Transfer both files to Kali, 5) Parse with secretsdump: impacket-secretsdump -ntds ntds.dit -system system.hive LOCAL. OUTPUT: ALL domain credentials (same as -just-dc DCSync). ADVANTAGE: Works offline (no network interaction, no detection), can be done from backup files.

OSCP WORKFLOW: 1) Obtain admin NTLM hash via LSASS dump or secretsdump -sam on compromised machine, 2) Use hash for DCSync without knowing plaintext password: impacket-secretsdump -hashes :2892d26cdf84d7a70e2eb3b9f05c425e corp.com/administrator@192.168.50.70. TIME SAVER: Skips password cracking phase (can take hours/days if complex password). DETECTION: Identical to password auth (NTLM challenge-response), no special indicators. OPSEC: Cleaner than plaintext password in command history (less sensitive if logs captured)."

WHY USE: (1) Universal - works on all Windows versions (XP through 11), (2) No dependencies - always available even in restricted shells, (3) Fast - reads entire file instantly, (4) Pipeable - can combine with 'findstr' for grep-like functionality: type file.txt | findstr 'password'. LIMITATIONS: No pagination (entire file dumps at once), no line numbers, no syntax highlighting."
"84857049e920d30e","Path handling","Windows paths use backslashes (\) which are escape characters in some shells. SOLUTIONS: (1) Double backslashes in scripts: type C:\\Users\\admin\\file.txt, (2) Use forward slashes (Windows accepts): type C:/Users/admin/file.txt, (3) Use quotes for paths with spaces: type ""C:\Program Files\app\config.ini"", (4) Tab completion in interactive shells.

WORKAROUNDS: Copy file first: copy locked.txt C:\temp\unlocked.txt, then read copy. Check existence: if exist C:\file.txt (type C:\file.txt) else (echo Not found)."
"137a453e9b414e2c","Get-Content cmdlet","PowerShell cmdlet (not CMD command) for reading files. ALIAS: cat, gc, type (in PowerShell context).

TRADEOFF: Slower than CMD 'type', requires PowerShell environment."

Wrong encoding shows garbage characters or missing content. DEFAULT: UTF-8 in PowerShell 6+, Unicode in PowerShell 5.1. EXAM TIP: If file appears empty or corrupted with 'type', try Get-Content with -Encoding Unicode."

"0e68ab1d37a9229f","-Wait flag","Monitor file for new content (like 'tail -f'). SYNTAX: Get-Content file.log -Wait -Tail 10. BEHAVIOR: Displays last 10 lines, then blocks and shows new lines as appended. CTRL+C to exit. WHY USEFUL: Monitor application logs in real-time, debug running processes, watch for trigger events.

CRITICAL: Requires Domain Admin or replication rights (DS-Replication-Get-Changes, DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All)."
"d6a6261332a7cb1d","/user:<DOMAIN>\<USERNAME>","Specifies the target account to replicate. Format must include domain prefix (DOMAIN\user or DOMAIN.COM\user). The backslash must be escaped in some contexts (double backslash in scripts). Common targets: krbtgt (RID 502), Administrator (RID 500), service accounts (SPN-based accounts like sqlsvc, backup-svc). WHY specific user: Reduces noise and log volume compared to dumping all hashes."
"0c16a96f151e7664","Optional: /domain:<DOMAIN_FQDN>","Explicitly specify target domain FQDN. Usually auto-detected from /user parameter, but useful in multi-domain forests or when current domain context is ambiguous. Example: /domain:corp.com"

"47452a7a3ddbb7d1","/user:krbtgt","The Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket account. This is a DISABLED built-in account (cannot be used for authentication directly). Its ONLY purpose is password hash storage for TGT encryption. CRITICAL: The krbtgt password is randomly generated at domain creation and ONLY changes during domain functional level upgrades (Server 2003 -> 2008+). In mature environments, this hash may be 10+ years old, providing extremely stable persistence."
"55137dfea2babbb4","Why krbtgt is critical","With krbtgt hash, you can create Golden Tickets (forged TGTs) that grant Domain Admin rights to ANY user. These tickets are valid until krbtgt password changes (rare). The DC cannot revoke Golden Tickets because they're cryptographically valid. This is the ULTIMATE persistence mechanism in Active Directory."

"0aa035dbcdd05811","/domain","Target domain's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). Example: corp.com, internal.local, ad.example.com. CRITICAL: Use the FQDN format, not NetBIOS name. The DCSync protocol requires proper domain specification for replication requests."

"89beacbf7ee48e3d","/patch","Patches LSASS.exe memory to bypass security protections that prevent credential dumping. This temporarily modifies the LSASS process in-memory to disable safeguards. CRITICAL: Use 'privilege::debug' first to obtain SeDebugPrivilege, which is required for LSASS memory access.

"64444240b44af2c8","kerberos::purge","Mimikatz module that removes all Kerberos tickets from the current logon session's ticket cache. Equivalent to 'klist purge' but works even when klist fails. This clears both TGTs (Ticket Granting Tickets) and TGS tickets (service tickets). CRITICAL: Purge tickets BEFORE creating a Golden Ticket to ensure Windows uses the forged ticket instead of cached legitimate tickets. The purge only affects the current session - other logged-in users retain their tickets."
"6c725f3bf1531480","kerberos::golden","Mimikatz module for forging Kerberos tickets (both TGTs and TGS). When used with /krbtgt parameter, it creates a Golden Ticket (TGT). The forged ticket is encrypted with the krbtgt password hash, making it indistinguishable from legitimate TGTs issued by the KDC. Windows systems trust this ticket because it has valid encryption."
"05b1dd9ddfceac0a","/user","Account name to impersonate in the forged ticket. CRITICAL: As of July 2022 Microsoft security updates, this MUST be an existing domain account. Prior to this update, fictional usernames worked. Use a real low-privileged account (e.g., 'jen', 'bob') - the ticket's group memberships grant Domain Admin rights regardless of the real account's privileges. WHY: This provides stealth - using 'Administrator' is obvious, using 'jen' with DA rights is subtle."
"d3d567ff3861c547","/sid","Domain Security Identifier WITHOUT the RID (Relative Identifier). Format: S-1-5-21-XXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXX.

By possessing this hash, we can forge TGTs that the domain controller will trust and decrypt. The KDC has no way to distinguish our forged TGT from a legitimate one because the encryption is valid. CRITICAL: This is the most sensitive credential in Active Directory - protect it carefully."
"4805cc6a3c83ff36","/ptt","Pass The Ticket - automatically inject the forged ticket into the current session's Kerberos ticket cache after creation. Without this flag, the ticket is only created but not used. WITH /ptt: Ticket is immediately usable for authentication. Alternative: Use /ticket parameter to save to file, then 'kerberos::ptt <file>' to inject later. WHY /ptt: Streamlines the attack - create and use in one command."
"eba09c1d3f0f9fa8","Default: /id:500","Mimikatz automatically sets the forged user's RID to 500 (built-in Administrator). This doesn't change the /user value shown in the ticket, but affects internal ticket structure. WHY 500: Ensures maximum compatibility and privileges."
"d989257cbb550ade","Default: /groups:513,512,520,518,519","Mimikatz automatically adds the user to the most privileged groups: 512 (Domain Admins), 513 (Domain Users), 518 (Schema Admins), 519 (Enterprise Admins), 520 (Group Policy Creator Owners). These group memberships grant domain-wide administrative access. The domain controller trusts these group claims because the ticket encryption is valid."
"2fb91c765405fbfd","golden","Rubeus command for Golden Ticket creation. Rubeus is a C# toolset for Kerberos abuse, compiled as a .NET assembly.

"16f6094fef6e8a0e","/rc4","NTLM hash of krbtgt account. In Rubeus, RC4 encryption is specified with /rc4 flag (unlike Mimikatz which uses /krbtgt). WHY RC4: Fastest encryption, widest compatibility. Tradeoff: RC4 is deprecated and monitored by modern SOCs. For evasion, use /aes256 instead (requires AES krbtgt key)."
"8a0b9cb703dd180b","Alternative: /aes256:<AES_KEY>","Use AES256 encryption instead of RC4. Requires AES256 krbtgt key (obtain with: lsadump::dcsync /domain:<DOMAIN> /user:krbtgt).

LEGITIMACY: Part of Sysinternals suite, Microsoft-signed binary, used by IT administrators for troubleshooting application crashes. WHY AV BYPASS: Procdump itself is benign - creates memory dumps for any process. Using it for LSASS is suspicious but not blocked by most AV. No credential extraction happens on target (only memory copy). Download from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump OR Evil-WinRM upload."

(2) Not flagged by Windows Defender (never executes on target). (3) Open-source, auditable code. (4) Actively maintained by SkelSec. INSTALLATION: Kali default (sudo apt install pypykatz) OR pip3 install pypykatz. CAPABILITIES: Parses LSASS dumps, SAM/LSA registry hives, Kerberos ccache files.
