step 1: `id` (what groups do i belong to) 
uid:1000 - first user created
gid: 1000- Group user id

step 2: `cat /etc/passwd` or `column -t -s ':' /etc/passwd` 
- Look for accounts which infer information such as www-data
- x in second column means the password hash is stored in /etc/shadow
- Normal User accounts start counting from 1000 (so 1001 is also a 'regular user'
- /usr/sbin/nologin in final column indicates remote operations cannot be performed
** www-data - web server / web access is possible.
** sshh - SSH is running

**/home - The user has been configured with a login
** /bin/bash - 

step 3: `hostname`

- Hostname often contains domain configuration information.

step 4: Identify the role of the machine

*** ` cat /etc/issue

step 5: enumerate services

*** `ps aux`


step 6: enumerate the network interfaces, routes, and open ports

-`ip a` or `ifconfig a` - List network interfaces and connections

- `route` or routel` - view routing tables

- `netstat -anp` or `ss -anp` - view all listening ports and active sessions

Step 7: Firewall rule exploration

-`iptables` -if root privileged
- `cat /etc/iptables/*` - Read firewall rules

**** footnotes
-- `iptables-save` - Used to dump Firewall rules to a readable specified location (ROOT only)
-- `iptables-restore` - Used to restore firewall rules using save command output at boot
-- search /etc/ or grep filesystem for iptables commands to locate the file.


Step 8: Examine cron jobs
** ` ls -lah /etc/cron*`
- `crontab -l` - View Current Users active scheduled jobs
- `sudo crontab -l` - reveals jobs run by root user


Step 9: Enumerate applications for Exploit opportunities

** `dpkg -l`
-- dpkg for linux
-- rpm for redhat

Step 10: Identify files/dirs with insecure permissions

** `find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null`

Step 11: Drive enumeration
** Search for unmounted drives.
- check mount permissions.

- `cat /etc/fstab` - List all drives that will be mounted at boot time.
- `mount`
- `lsblk` -- may reveal partitions which are not mounted.


Step 11: Enumerate list of driver and kernel modules

-`ls mod` - list all loaded kernel modules - Investigate interesting findings
- `/sbin/modinfo <MODULE_NAME>`


step 12: Search for SUID pe
** `find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`
